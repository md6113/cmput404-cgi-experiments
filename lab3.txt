1. By doing an import os in python in the hello.py file, then pprint(dict(os.environ)).
The pprint is not necessary but it makes it more readable.
This is viewable by just going to:
localhost:8000/hello.py

params = urlparse.parse_qs(os.environ['QUERY_STRING'])

3. The 'HTTP_USER_AGENT' variable, and you can access the info contained within using the following call:
user_agent = os.environ['HTTP_USER_AGENT']

4. It comes via stdin and is accessible by declaring how bytes there are to read, and then grabbing them from stdin:
content_length = os.environ['CONTENT_LENGTH']
bytes_to_read = int(content_length)
content = sys.stdin.read(bytes_to_read)

5. Setting a cookie is as easy as:
